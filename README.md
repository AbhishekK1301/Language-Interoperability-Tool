## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 **Lexical Analyzer (Tokenizer):** Breaks Python code into meaningful tokens.  
- 🧠 **Parser:** Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.  
- ⚙️ **Intermediate Code Generator:** Generates intermediate representation (IR) for each statement.  
- 💻 **C++ Code Generator:** Produces final C++ code from IR.  
- 🪟 **Interactive GUI:** Built with Tkinter for an easy and visual translation process.
